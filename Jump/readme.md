It's a module that can transport 11 signals from one point to another point. Super useful if you have two eurorack cases. 
[Mouser Cart](https://www.mouser.com/ProjectManager/ProjectDetail.aspx?AccessID=3f3b3b9838), the mouser cart contains parts for two of these modules. Since you'd obviously need two of them two go from point A to point B.
